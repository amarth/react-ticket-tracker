Simple ticket grid in react.js.

There are three color-coded types of tickets - 'info', 'notification' and 'issue'.
Tickets may be moved to the previous/next column by clicking on an left or right arrow button. 
A ticket cannot be returned to the 'inbox' or moved from 'confirmed' state.
Detailed view may be opened by clicking on ticket and closed by clicking on the same ticket again or clicking on the close button.
User can add comments in the detailed view.
State of the grid is saved in the local storage and will persist across multiple sessions from the same machine and browser.

Panel on the right allows to add new random ticket, reset grid state to default or clear board.
